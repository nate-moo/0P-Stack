/*
 * stack-stage3.h
 *
 * Implements a simple stack class using dynamic arrays.
 * This may be implemented in 3 stages:
 *   Stage 1: non-template stack class storing strings,
 *            unsafe copies/assignments
 *   Stage 2: template stack class, unsafe copies/assignments
 *   Stage 3: template stack class, safe copies/assignments
 *
 * Note: no underflow detection is performed.  Performing pop() or top()
 * on an empty stack results in undefined behavior (possibly crashing your
 * program)!

// To start stage 2, you probably want to copy all of your code from
// stack-stage1.h and stack-stage1.cpp in place of this comment.

/***
 * DO NOT put unscoped 'using namespace std;' in header files!
 * Instead use the std:: prefix where required in class definitions, as
 * demonstrated in the stack starter code for stage1.
